_CarePackage_ is a desktop application for Windows 10/11 heavily inspired by [Ninite](https://ninite.com/) that makes it quick and easy to download and install all of your favorite programs at once. CarePackage's intended use case is to be used on a new installation of Windows, but of course you can use it however you'd like!

CarePackage is built with Windows Forms on .NET 8.0.

What CarePackage **DOES**:
- Downloads the __latest__ versions of the programs you select
- Installs each program, one after another, or presents the files if the downloaded programs are compressed archives
- Allows you to opt out of installing the programs after they've been downloaded

What CarePackage **DOESN'T DO**
- Check for program updates
- Update installed programs
  - Most programs allow you to update installations by running a new installer

### Installing CarePackage

CarePackage is a single executable and doesn't require any installation. You can download the latest `carepackage.exe` [here.](https://github.com/depthbomb/CarePackage/releases/latest)
